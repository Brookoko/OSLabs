# OS Labs
This repository contains practical works of the OS course at the KPI university

## Lab1: _General-purpose allocator_
The first laboratory work is about creating your own allocator that can able to work with data of different sizes.
The details of implementation and explanation of algorithm can be found [here](./Lab1/README.md).

## Lab2: _Page allocator_
The second laboratory work is about creating page allocator.
to improve allocator implementation developed in the last work.
The details of implementation and explanation of algorithm can be found [here](./Lab2/README.md).

## Lab3: _Process Manager_
The third laboratory work is about simulating process manager.
The details of implementation and explanation of algorithm can be found [here](./Lab3Sharp/README.md).

## Lab4: _Dynamic Process Scheduling with realtime constraints_
The forth laboratory work is about implementing process scheduler.
My variant it is dynamic process scheduling with realtime constraints using hungarian algorithm.
The details of implementation and explanation of algorithm can be found [here](./Lab4/README.md).

## Lab5: _Memory Access Optimization_
The fifth laboratory work is memory access optimization.
The explanation can be found [here](./Lab5/README.md).

## Lab6: _Profiling_
The sixth laboratory work is about profiling.
The details can be found [here](./Lab6/README.md).
